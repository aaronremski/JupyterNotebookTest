# JupyterNotebookTest

# Summary
This repo is created to illustrate several methods for version control of Jupyter Notebooks. 
<br/><br/>
## Method 1
https://mg.readthedocs.io/git-jupyter.html

<br/>
Notebook name: JupyterNotebookTest1<br/>
Branches used: Main, rottentomato<br/>
<br/>
**_Notes on Method 1_**<br/>
These solutions appear to be older, ~6-7 years, and after reviewing documenation, a little too cumbersome for me. Working with method 2 for a while and will determine best fit solution 
<br/>
## Method 2

<br/>
Basically, you're not tracking .ipynb or checkout files. You convert to jupytertext FIRST and track all changes via converted .py files. Works nicely and you can include instructions for cloning/forking/etc a repo and converting BACK to ipynb for project continuation.
