# Summary

Notebook name: JupyterNotebookTest1<br/>
Branches used: Main, rottentomato<br/>
<br/>
**_Notes on Method 1_**<br/>
These solutions appear to be older, ~6-7 years, and after reviewing documenation, a little too cumbersome for me. Working with method 2 for a while and will determine best fit solution

<br/>
Basically, you're not tracking .ipynb or checkout files. You convert to jupytertext FIRST and track all changes via converted .py files. Works nicely and you can include instructions for cloning/forking/etc a repo and converting BACK to ipynb for project continuation.
