# JupyterNotebookTest

# Summary
This repo is created to illustrate several methods for version control of Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Method 1
https://mg.readthedocs.io/git-jupyter.html 
which references: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18734739/using-ipython-notebooks-under-version-control/20844506
notebook name: JupyterNotebookTest1
Branches used: Main, rottentomato

### Notes on Method 1
These solutions appear to be quite old, ~6-7 years. I would think by now IPython & Git/Github have this worked out
